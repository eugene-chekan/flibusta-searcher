## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd flibusta-searcher
```

2. Install dependencies using `uv`:
```bash
uv sync
```

Alternatively, you can install using pip:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

### Interactive Mode

Simply run the CLI without any arguments to enter interactive mode:

```bash
uv run -m main
```


You'll be prompted to choose between searching for books or browsing an author's catalog.

### Command-Line Usage

#### Search for Books

```bash
# Search for books by title or author
uv run -m main search "Tolstoy"

# Or using the module directly
uv run -m main search "War and Peace"
```

#### Search for Authors

```bash
# Search for authors by name
uv run -m main search --authors "Dostoevsky"
```

#### List Books by Author ID

```bash
# Get all books by a specific author using their ID
uv run -m main author-books 123456
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Search for Books

```bash
$ uv run -m main search "1984"
```

This will display a table of books matching "1984" with their titles, authors, and available formats.

### Example 2: Interactive Author Search

```bash
$ uv run -m main search --authors "George Orwell"
```

After seeing the results, you can:
1. Enter an author number to view all their books
2. Enter a book number to see detailed information including description, cover, and download links

### Example 3: Browse Author's Complete Catalog

```bash
$ uv run -m main author-books 12345
```

This displays all books by the author with ID 12345.

## Development

### Dependencies

- **typer**: CLI framework with type hints
- **rich**: Terminal formatting and tables
- **httpx**: HTTP client for API requests
- **feedparser**: OPDS catalog parsing

### Development Tools

- **ruff**: Linting and formatting
- **ty**: Type checking

### Running Tests

## How It Works

The tool interacts with Flibusta's OPDS (Open Publication Distribution System) catalog to:

2. Parse XML/Atom feeds to extract book and author information
3. Handle pagination automatically to retrieve complete result sets
4. Display results in formatted tables with clickable links
